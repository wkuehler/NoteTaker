# Note Taker

The goal of this project is to create a flow which would allow us to take notes during a demo or other call with a client.  Some fields are then saved directly to related Opportunity fields, some fields are pushed into the description of a new task and, if the client requests a follow up call, and future task is created on the appropriate date.
